# Navya_Assignment Assignment 

Problem Statement:
Assume that a product manager has given following requirement to develop a simple Single Page
App and the developer came with an implementation (just download this file and open it in
browser).
We would like you to do following exercises:
1. Come up with a comprehensive set of test cases for the given requirement - state
assumption that you are making, if any. Write them as formally as possible - use excel or
any other tool you are comfortable with. test cases should cover usability, functionality,
edge cases, security and any other areas you can think of.
2. Pickup top 5 important cases - at least 2-3 on infinite scrolling and automate it using
selenium/protractor script. Give instructions on how to run it on the page given in above
link.
Requirement from Product Manager :
Description
Replicate Facebook home page layout i.e. a header, 2 sidebars, an infinite content column.
Header: Header (fixed at top) can have a logo/text and a navigation menu icon both on different
ends of the layout.
Sidebars: Should contain well formatted sample links.
Content: Should have infinite scrollable content (up to 50 posts with numbers).
Behavior:
On mobile devices, only content column should be visible. Sidebar content should be transformed
into a menu. This menu will be added in the header. Content column will occupy full width.
In non-mobile devices, sidebars should have 30% width each and content column should be 40%
wide.
Follow the same dimensions for width and height which are used on Facebook.
Use bootstrap and AngualrJS to solve this. Follow HTML5 conventions.
Evaluation criteria : Completeness of test cases, Ability to handle ambiguity in requirement. Corner
cases coverage, Usage of tools(selenium/protractor) and fool proof css selector for automation
Note : Please send us the actual time you took to complete the exercise.
